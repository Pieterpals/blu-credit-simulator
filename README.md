- **GitHub Actions** builds and tests the project.
- **Docker Hub** stores the built images.
- **CI/CD ensures fresh deployment on each push**.

### **ðŸ”¹ How It Works**
1. **Push code to GitHub**  
2. **GitHub Actions builds the Docker image**  
3. **Image is pushed to Docker Hub**  
4. **You can pull & run it anywhere**  

#### **ðŸ”¹ Run the App from Docker Hub**
